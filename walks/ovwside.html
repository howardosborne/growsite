  <p>The 150 mile-long Ouse Valley Way is a fascinating cross-section through England. It’s a chance to discover how the country has been shaped by the river and allowed our ancestors to prosper. It passes through ancient villages, new towns and communities of the future.</p>

<p>Seeing how our country has come to be as it is poses questions about the future. You’ll get the chance to meet some of the people for whom the river plays a part of their daily lives. The walk is described below in three sections and reflects the different character of each stretch of the river.</p>

<div id="map" class="col-md-12" style="height: 600px;">

## Headwaters: Syresham to Bedford 
&gt; ~~every thousand mile journey starts with a single step~~

&gt; getting lost is part of the journey

In this stretch we'll be spending time following the streams, brooks and ditches and walking through fields with the occasional sight of a hare or deer but usually accompanied by the sound of blackbirds, great tits and skylarks.

It's fair to say that maintenance of this part of the Way has been rather neglected in parts. Known issues are marked on the map, as are alternative routes.

### legs

- [Syresham to Buckingham (12 km)](#1-syresham-to-buckingham-12-km)
- [Buckingham to Stony Stratford (15 km)](#2-buckingham-to-stony-stratford-15-km)
- [Stony Stratford to Newport Pagnell (16.5 km)](#3-stony-stratford-to-newport-pagnell-165-km)

- [Olney to Odell (13 km)](#5-olney-to-odell-13-km)
- [Odell to Pavenham (10.5 km)](#6-odell-to-pavenham-105-km)
- [Pavenham to Bedford (15.5 km)](#7-pavenham-to-bedford-155-km)

## The Navigable River: Bedford to Earith

From the retreat of the Romans to the industrial revolution, it's fair to say that England wasn't very easy to get around. As a result, it was towns set on navigable rivers that prospered from the free-flow of trade while the abundance of water powered various mills.

From Bedford onwards we'll see a series of places that have benefitted from trade links and the source of power all while having to deal with the tricky business of managing too much water at times of flood.

### legs
- [Bedford to Great Barford (11 km)](#1-bedford-to-great-barford-11-km)
- [Great Barford to St Neots (15.5 km)](#2-great-barford-to-st-neots-155-km)
- [St Neots to Godmanchester (16.4 km)](#3-st-neots-to-godmanchester-164-km)
- [Godmanchester to Holywell (12.5 km)](#4-godmanchester-to-holywell-125-km)
- [Holywell to Earith (7.5 km)](#5-holywell-to-earith-75-km)

## Fens: Ely to Kings Lynn

The Fens are unique - or at least unique to England. Over in the Netherlands, reclaimed land put to good use is commonplace, but this landscape created with the help of a [Dutch engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Vermuyden) has been feeding England since the Civil War. 

Compared to the walks in the previous sections, these are sparser in features and, for practical reaons, longer in distance (there are some suggested places to stop en-route). Nevertheless, they offer a profound lesson in how we use land and where we can provide opportunities to let nature co-exist.

### legs
- [Earith to Ely (25 km)](#1-earith-to-ely-25-km)
- [Ely to Downham Market (28 km)](#2-ely-to-downham-market-28-km)
- [Downham Market to Kings Lynn (18.5 km)](#3-downham-market-to-kings-lynn-185-km)
